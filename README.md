# Max/MSP patch developed for Praetorian's 2024 spatialized live show

### instructions

open `max/Praetorian-Around-Space.maxpat` with Max (made with Max 8) and have a look at it.

### disclaimer

the required multichannel files with separate instument tracks are not available here, and neither are the recorded source trajectories used during the live show. this repository is for backup and inspection purposes only, it will not work and likely produce a lot of errors.
